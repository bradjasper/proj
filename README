Proj is a lightweight project manager for the terminal


Given a PROJECT_DIR you can do things like:
    - Automatically create ctags
    - Making a project active `ma rent`
        - Django
    - Jumping to a project `(proj|project) rentacarnow`


TODO:
 - Onload script for make_active
    - When making a project active, you should be able to run a directory
    of scripts. For example:
        ./django.sh - Check for django project, if so setup environment
